# gpt-readme

## Introduction
The `gpt-readme` module is a Python code library that generates README files for code repositories. It utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to summarize code modules and files, providing comprehensive documentation and understanding of the code. This module consists of various submodules and code files that handle different aspects of the README generation process.

## Get Started
To install the `gpt-readme` module, you can use either of the following methods:

1. Install from PyPI:
   ```
   pip install gpt-readme
   ```

2. Install from the source GitHub repository:
   ```
   pip install git+https://github.com/gusye1234/gpt-readme.git
   ```

Once installed, you can use the `gpt-readme` command directly in the command line.

To generate a README file, use the following command:
```
gpt-readme --path <code_path> --exts <code_extensions> --language <readme_language> --demand <additional_requirements> --out <output_file> --cache <cache_option> --agree
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for your code repository. The available options include specifying the code repository path, code extension names, readme language, additional requirements, output file path, cache option, and agreement to send the code to OpenAI for processing.

## Features
The `gpt-readme` module supports the following main features:

1. Summarizing directories and files within the codebase: The `dir_summary` submodule is responsible for generating summaries of directories and files. It utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate summaries based on prompts constructed from system and module-specific information.

2. Summarizing code files: The `file_summary` module provides functionality for summarizing individual code files. It uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate a summary based on the code content.

These features allow users to quickly understand the functionality and purpose of the codebase, making it easier to navigate and work with the code.

## Implementation
The `gpt-readme` module consists of the following submodules and code files:

- `__init__.py`: This file defines the version, author, and URL of the `gpt-readme` package. It does not contain any code implementation.

- `__main__.py`: This file serves as the entry point for the code. It imports the `main` function from the `main` module and executes it when the file is run as a script.

- `constants.py`: This code file defines variables and a function related to the GPT-Readme project. It provides mappings between file extensions and programming languages, as well as a function to generate a readme header.

- `dir_summary.py`: This file is responsible for summarizing directories and files within the codebase. It uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate summaries based on prompts constructed from system and module-specific information.

- `file_summary.py`: This module provides functionality for summarizing code files. It uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate a summary based on the code content.

- `main.py`: This script uses ChatGPT to generate a README file based on code. It takes command-line arguments such as the code repository path, code extension names, and readme language.

- `prompts.py`: This code file contains string variables that serve as prompts for generating documentation for code modules and files. It provides instructions and guidelines for summarizing the functionality of the code.

- `utils.py`: This file provides various utility functions for setting up the environment, handling caching, hashing content, and constructing prompts and summaries.

## Acknowledgement
The `gpt-readme` module relies on the following third-party libraries:

- `rich.console`: A library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.
- `openai.ChatCompletion`: A library for interacting with the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- `rich.markdown`: A library for rendering Markdown text in the terminal.
- `os`: A module for interacting with the operating system.
- `openai`: A library for accessing the OpenAI API.
- `argparse`: A module for parsing command-line arguments.
- `json`: A module for working with JSON data.
- `hashlib`: A module for hashing data.
- `getpass`: A module for secure password input.
- `rich.prompt`: A library for creating interactive prompts in the terminal.

These libraries provide essential functionality for the `gpt-readme` module and are greatly appreciated.
